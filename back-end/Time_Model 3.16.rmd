```{r, include=FALSE}
data <- read.csv("time_temp.csv")
attach(data)
```

```{r}
data1 <- head(data,4000)
```

```{r cars}
model1 <- lm(time ~ seller, data = data1)
summary(model1)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
